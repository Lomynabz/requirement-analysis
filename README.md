# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requrement analysis is all the requirements needed in creating or accomplishing the project at hand
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
These are the seven reasons as to why the Requirement Analysis is important
### 1. Ensures Alignment with User Needs:
Requirement analysis helps developers understand the actual needs and expectations of various stakeholders, ensuring the final product is valuable and usable. 
### 2. Minimizes Costly Changes:
Identifying and clarifying requirements early in the development process helps to prevent issues and conflicts that would be expensive and time-consuming to fix later. 
### 3. Prevents Scope Creep:
By clearly defining what the software should and should not do, requirement analysis helps manage project scope and prevents unnecessary additions to the project. 
### 4. Provides a Clear Basis for Design:
The analysis creates clear, actionable, and testable requirements, which serve as the foundation for the subsequent design and development phases. 
### 5. Improves Communication and Collaboration:
It facilitates a shared understanding among all stakeholders, including developers, designers, and clients, fostering collaboration and a common vision. 
### 6. Reduces Project Risks:
A thorough requirement analysis lowers the risk of project failure by ensuring the project's objectives are well-understood and feasible. 
### 7. Supports Verification and Validation:
It provides the basis for verification (ensuring the software is built correctly to the specifications) and validation (ensuring the software meets the user's actual needs). 
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
Requirement analysis ensures that software solutions align with business objectives and user expectations. The process involves five key activities:
- Requirement Gathering
Collecting raw requirements from stakeholders, clients, and end-users.
Sources include interviews, surveys, existing system documentation, and direct observation.
Focus is on capturing all potential needs without filtering or judgment at this stage.
- Requirement Elicitation
Engaging with stakeholders to clarify and refine gathered requirements.
Techniques include workshops, brainstorming sessions, prototyping, and questionnaires.
The goal is to uncover implicit needs, constraints, and expectations that may not be immediately obvious.
- Requirement Documentation
Structuring requirements into clear, concise, and accessible formats.
Common outputs include Software Requirement Specifications (SRS), user stories, and use cases.
Documentation ensures all parties share a consistent understanding of system needs.
- Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Reviewing and breaking down requirements to identify conflicts, overlaps, or gaps.
Applying modeling techniques such as data flow diagrams, UML diagrams, or process models.
Helps visualize system behavior, dependencies, and business workflows.
- Requirement Validation
Ensuring requirements are complete, consistent, feasible, and testable.
Stakeholder reviews, walkthroughs, and prototyping are common validation methods.
Confirms alignment with business goals before moving into design and development.
