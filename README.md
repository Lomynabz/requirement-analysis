# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requrement analysis is all the requirements needed in creating or accomplishing the project at hand
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
These are the seven reasons as to why the Requirement Analysis is important
### 1. Ensures Alignment with User Needs:
Requirement analysis helps developers understand the actual needs and expectations of various stakeholders, ensuring the final product is valuable and usable. 
### 2. Minimizes Costly Changes:
Identifying and clarifying requirements early in the development process helps to prevent issues and conflicts that would be expensive and time-consuming to fix later. 
### 3. Prevents Scope Creep:
By clearly defining what the software should and should not do, requirement analysis helps manage project scope and prevents unnecessary additions to the project. 
### 4. Provides a Clear Basis for Design:
The analysis creates clear, actionable, and testable requirements, which serve as the foundation for the subsequent design and development phases. 
### 5. Improves Communication and Collaboration:
It facilitates a shared understanding among all stakeholders, including developers, designers, and clients, fostering collaboration and a common vision. 
### 6. Reduces Project Risks:
A thorough requirement analysis lowers the risk of project failure by ensuring the project's objectives are well-understood and feasible. 
### 7. Supports Verification and Validation:
It provides the basis for verification (ensuring the software is built correctly to the specifications) and validation (ensuring the software meets the user's actual needs).
